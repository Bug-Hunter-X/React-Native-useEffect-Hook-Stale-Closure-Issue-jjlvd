This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development involving the `useEffect` hook. When an empty dependency array `[]` is used with `useEffect`, the effect only runs once after the initial render.  This example showcases a scenario where this behavior leads to stale closures, resulting in unexpected behavior when state or props change.  The solution demonstrates the correct usage of the dependency array to ensure the effect re-runs when necessary.
